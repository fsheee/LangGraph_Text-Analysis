# LangGraph_Text-Analysis
<h2>Introduction to LangGraph</h2>

LangGraph is a framework for creating applications using graph-based workflows. Each node represents a function or computational step, and edges define the flow between these nodes based on certain conditions.<

# Key Features:
<li>State Management</li>
<li>Flexible Routing</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
 
 demonstrate the power of LangGraph by building a multi-step text analysis pipeline. Our use case will focus on processing a given text through three key stages:

**Text** Classification: We'll categorize the input text into predefined categories (e.g., News, Blog, Research, or Other).
<br>
**Entity** Extraction: We'll identify and extract key entities such as persons, organizations, and locations from the text.
<br>
**Text Summarization:** Finally, we'll generate a concise summary of the input text.
<br>
this pipeline showcases how LangGraph can be used to create a modular, extensible workflow for natural language processing tasks. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand
how to construct a graph-based application that can be easily modified or expanded for various text analysis needs.
